## CSS

Drawer uses only `fixed position` in especial. Not used absolute. It's a very  useful.

  - Theme

``` css
.drawer-defult
.drawer-navbar-default
```

## LESS

drawer uses [grunt-autoprefixer](https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer).

> [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) parses CSS and adds vendor-prefixed CSS properties using the Can I Use database.

## Deprecated off screen

Do not use minus value of left property in drawer-overlay even if you want `off screen` or called `off canvas` menu . You need to be very careful with it. There is a fixed position issue in safari on iOS8.
